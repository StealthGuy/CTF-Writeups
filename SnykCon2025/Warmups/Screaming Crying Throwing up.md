## Writeup

As the title and description suggest, this challenge is based on the [scream cipher](https://github.com/matthewpwatkins/scream-cipher).  
I opened the .bin file in VSCode because if opened on a powershell terminal or bash the strange characters are not outputted correctly and won't decode to the flag.

Then I used [this online tool](https://scream-cipher.netlify.app/) to decode the strange text and get the flag.
