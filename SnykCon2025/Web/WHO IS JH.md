## Writeup

In the Dockerfile I can see where the flag is located:

In the same Dockerfile I can also see that some PHP functions are disable to prevent RCE:

The listed functions are used to execute system commands, specifically:

- **exec($cmd)**: Executes a system command and returns the output as a string
- **system($cmd)**: Executes a command and immediately displays the output on the screen
- **shell_exec($cmd)**: Similar to exec(), but returns the entire output as a string
- **passthru($cmd)**: Executes a command and prints the output without buffering (useful for binaries with binary output)
- **popen($cmd, $mode)**: Opens a process and returns a handle to read/write to the command stream
- **proc_open($cmd, $descriptorspec, &$pipes)**: Similar to popen(), but allows more granular control over process input/output

Looking at the PHP source code, I can see that there is a pubblicy log file that I can access with directory "logs/site_log.txt":

I can upload an allowed image with extension JPG, PNG, GIF and see it in the log file:

With **curl** on the terminal:

The image is uploaded with the original name and a `uniqid` generated by the code:

Anyway, the file upload is not very restricted. The extension is checked, but the content isn't:

Continuing the code analysis, I can see that the conspiracy.php endpoint allows the user to include a file based on the language parameter:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83fa5209-4bf5-4c5f-bbaf-8d83b8436fb5)

This endpoint and its query parameter "language" is vulnerable, so I have a valid attack chain to upload a `file.jpg` with PHP code with **BurpSuite**, use the log to figure out the random name it was given and then use the conspiracy endpoint to include it and run my code.

Intercepted the **POST request** in Burp, modified the **Content-Type** of the JPG image in the **Repeater** tab and successfully uploaded:

It also works with this PHP payload:

```bash
<?php echo file_get_contents("/flag.txt")?>
```

**flag{6558608db040d1c64358ad536a8e06c6}**
